## 🧪 Testing

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

```bash
✓ Compiled successfully in 8.1s
✓ Finished TypeScript in 4.5s
✓ Collecting page data in 729.5ms
✓ Generating static pages (13/13) in 544.8ms
✓ Finalizing page optimization in 17.3ms
```

### How to Test:

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the test page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/example-uploader
   ```

3. **Try uploading files:**
   - Use the UploadButton (click to select files)
   - Use the UploadDropzone (drag and drop files)

4. **Expected behavior:**
   - Files upload to UploadThing CDN
   - Console logs file metadata
   - Alert shows "Upload Completed"

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Authentication Dependency (Phase 1)

The upload middleware is currently configured but returns a temporary user ID:

```typescript
// Current (temporary):
return { userId: "temp-user-id" };

// After Phase 1 Auth0 integration:
return { userId: session.user.sub };
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ File uploads work and are functional
- ⚠️ Files aren't tied to real users yet
- ⚠️ Requires Phase 1 (Auth0) completion for full security

### Database Integration Pending

Files upload successfully but aren't saved to your database yet. Once you're ready to integrate with Prisma:

```typescript
// Add to onUploadComplete in core.ts:
await prisma.file.create({
  data: {
    name: file.name,
    type: file.type,
    url: file.url,
    key: file.key,
    size: file.size,
    userId: metadata.userId,
  }
});
```

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Simple Upload Button

```tsx
import { UploadButton } from "@/lib/uploadthing";

<UploadButton
  endpoint="courseFiles"
  onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
    console.log("Files:", res);
  }}
/>
```

### Drag-and-Drop Zone

```tsx
import { UploadDropzone } from "@/lib/uploadthing";

<UploadDropzone
  endpoint="courseFiles"
  onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
    console.log("Files:", res);
  }}
/>
```

### Custom Hook

```tsx
import { useUpload } from "@/hooks/useUpload";

const { uploadFiles, isUploading, uploadProgress } = useUpload();

// Upload files programmatically
await uploadFiles([file1, file2]);
```
