# ü§ñ AI Prompt Instructions for EduFlow Development

This document contains prompts and instructions for effectively working with GitHub Copilot on the EduFlow project.

---

## üéØ Project Context Prompt

```
I'm building EduFlow AI - a cloud-based study companion using Next.js, TypeScript, and React.
The app uses specialized AI agents (Notes, Flashcards, Quiz, Slides) to transform course materials
into study resources. We follow SOLID principles and clean architecture with:

- Domain Layer: Entities and interfaces
- Adapters Layer: External API integrations (Gemini, Whisper, Auth0, Supabase)
- Services Layer: Business logic
- API Routes: Next.js route handlers
- UI Layer: React components with React Flow for canvas view

Tech stack: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Prisma, Supabase, Auth0, Gemini API, self-hosted Whisper,
UploadThing, React Flow, Framer Motion, TanStack Query.

Always maintain:
1. Strict TypeScript typing
2. SOLID principles
3. Dependency injection through constructors
4. Interface-based abstractions
5. Comprehensive error handling
```

## üìù Common Development Prompts

### Creating New Features

#### New Agent
```
Create a new [AgentName]Agent that implements the IAgent interface.
It should:
- Use dependency injection for IModelClient
- Follow the prompt template pattern from src/domain/types/prompts.ts
- Include comprehensive TypeScript types
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch
- Return structured data matching OutputEntity

Example: "Create a SummaryAgent that generates concise summaries from transcripts"
```

#### New API Route
```
Create a new API route at /api/[route-name] that:
- Uses Next.js 16 App Router conventions
- Validates input with Zod schema
- Authenticates user with Auth0 getSession()
- Injects dependencies following DIP
- Returns typed JSON responses
- Handles errors with proper status codes

Example: "Create /api/refine route that lets users refine agent outputs via chat"
```

#### New React Component
```
Create a new React component [ComponentName] that:
- Uses TypeScript with proper prop types
- Follows our Tailwind + shadcn/ui styling patterns
- Implements loading and error states
- Uses React Query for data fetching if needed
- Includes Framer Motion animations where appropriate
- Is fully accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)

Example: "Create a FlashcardViewer component with flip animations"
```

### Refactoring Code

#### Extract Service
```
Refactor [FileName] to extract business logic into a new [ServiceName]Service that:
- Implements dependency injection
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle
- Has a clear interface definition
- Includes unit tests
- Moves logic from route handlers/components to service layer

Example: "Extract Canvas sync logic from route handler into CanvasService"
```

#### Add Interface
```
Create an I[InterfaceName] interface for [ConcreteClass] following Interface Segregation Principle.
Include:
- All public methods with full type signatures
- JSDoc comments explaining each method
- Example usage in comments
- Update constructor injection to use interface

Example: "Create IExporter interface for PDF, Anki, CSV exporters"
```

### Testing Prompts

#### Unit Test
```
Write comprehensive Vitest unit tests for [FileName] that:
- Mock all dependencies
- Cover happy path and edge cases
- Test error handling
- Achieve 90%+ coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example: "Write unit tests for NotesAgent with mocked model client"
```

#### Integration Test
```
Write integration test for [Feature] that:
- Tests full flow from API route to database
- Uses MSW to mock external APIs
- Includes setup/teardown for test database
- Tests success and failure scenarios

Example: "Write integration test for generate endpoint with Gemini API mocked"
```

### Debugging Prompts

#### Fix TypeScript Error
```
I'm getting TypeScript error: [error message]
In file: [file path]

Context:
- What I'm trying to do: [explanation]
- Current code: [paste code]
- Expected behavior: [explanation]

Fix the error while maintaining type safety and SOLID principles.
```

#### Performance Issue
```
[ComponentName/RouteName] is slow. Optimize it by:
- Identifying bottlenecks
- Adding React.memo/useMemo where appropriate
- Implementing pagination if needed
- Optimizing database queries
- Adding caching with React Query

Current implementation: [paste code]
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture-Specific Prompts

### Adding New AI Provider
```
Integrate [ProviderName] API as an alternative to Gemini:

1. Create adapter in src/adapters/[provider].adapter.ts implementing IModelClient
2. Add configuration to .env.local
3. Update generate service to support provider selection
4. Add fallback logic if primary provider fails
5. Include error handling and rate limiting
6. Add tests mocking the provider API

Example: "Add OpenRouter as fallback AI provider"
```

### Database Schema Change
```
I need to add [feature] which requires database changes:

1. Update Prisma schema with new model/fields
2. Create migration with `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. Generate Prisma client
4. Update TypeScript types
5. Update repository interface and implementation
6. Add seed data if needed
7. Update relevant services

Example: "Add 'tags' field to Course model for categorization"
```

### New Export Format
```
Implement [FormatName] export:

1. Create [Format]Exporter implementing IExporter interface
2. Add export logic in src/services/exporters/
3. Register in ExportService
4. Add download button in UI
5. Test with sample data
6. Update documentation

Example: "Add Notion export format for notes"
```

## üé® UI/UX Prompts

### Beautiful Component
```
Create a visually stunning [ComponentName] that:
- Uses Tailwind CSS with gradient backgrounds
- Implements smooth Framer Motion animations
- Has hover effects and micro-interactions
- Follows our color scheme (indigo/blue primary)
- Is responsive (mobile-first)
- Includes loading skeletons
- Has dark mode support

Reference: Look at existing components for style consistency

Example: "Create a CourseCard component with hover animations"
```

### Canvas Node
```
Create a custom React Flow node for [NodeType] that:
- Extends Handle components for connections
- Shows status indicators (idle/processing/complete)
- Has drag-and-drop functionality
- Displays relevant data in compact form
- Uses consistent styling with other nodes
- Animates on state changes

Example: "Create OutputNode that displays generated content preview"
```

### Form with Validation
```
Create a form for [purpose] with:
- React Hook Form for state management
- Zod schema validation
- Clear error messages
- Loading states on submit
- Success/error toast notifications
- Accessible form fields
- Progressive enhancement

Example: "Create Canvas token input form with validation"
```

- Data validation
- Zero-downtime approach

Example: "Migrate to add flashcard difficulty ratings"
```

## üéØ Quick Reference

### Code Style
- **Naming**: PascalCase for classes/components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **Files**: kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `generate.service.ts`)
- **Exports**: Named exports preferred over default exports
- **Imports**: Group by external, internal, relative; sort alphabetically

### TypeScript Patterns
```typescript
// Dependency Injection
constructor(private readonly dependency: IInterface) {}

// Error Handling
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error });
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}

// Type Guards
function isOutputEntity(obj: unknown): obj is OutputEntity {
  return obj instanceof OutputEntity;
}

// Discriminated Unions
type AgentType = 'notes' | 'flashcards' | 'quiz' | 'slides';
```

### React Patterns
```typescript
// Custom Hook
export function useFeature() {
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  const query = useQuery({ ... });
  return { state, setState, ...query };
}

// Component with Children
export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

// Conditional Rendering
{isLoading && <Skeleton />}
{error && <ErrorMessage error={error} />}
{data && <DataView data={data} />}
```
